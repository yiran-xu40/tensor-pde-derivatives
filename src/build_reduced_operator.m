% BUILD_REDUCED_OPERATOR Build reduced operator via Galerkin projection
%
% Implementation of the Galerkin projection method described in:
% "Tensor Forms of Derivatives of Matrices and their applications 
%  in the Solutions to Differential Equations"
%
% Constructs a reduced-order operator suitable for time integration
% in the compressed tensor space.
%
% INPUTS:
%   G_partial - Core tensor from Tucker decomposition
%   U5        - Factor matrix for mode 5
%   U6        - Factor matrix for mode 6
%
% OUTPUT:
%   R - Reduced operator matrix for time integration
